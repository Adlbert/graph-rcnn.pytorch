:balloon: 2019-06-04: Okaaay, time to reimplement Graph R-CNN on pytorch 1.0 and release a new benchmark for scene graph generation. It will also integrate other models like IMP, MSDN and Neural Motif Network. Stay tuned!

:balloon: 2019-06-16: Plan is a bit delayed by ICCV rebuttal,but still on track. Stay tuned!
