# graph-rcnn.pytorch
Pytorch code for our ECCV 2018 paper ["Graph R-CNN for Scene Graph Generation"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.00191.pdf)

2019-06-04: :balloon: Okaaay, time to reimplement Graph R-CNN on pytorch 1.0 and release a new benchmark for scene graph generation. It will also integrate other models like IMP, MSDN and Neural Motif Network. Stay tuned!
